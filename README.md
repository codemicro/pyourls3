A Python 3 API wrapper for [YOURLS](https://yourls.org/) - Pyourls3 is an API wrapper module written specifically for Python 3, to work with the YOURLS link shortener. It's
designed to supersede the old [`python-yourls`](https://pypi.org/project/python-yourls) written by [tflink](https://github.com/tflink),
built using the fantastic [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library.
